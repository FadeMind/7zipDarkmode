# 7zipDarkmode

![](7zDark.png)

inspired by https://github.com/ysc3839/win32-darkmode/tree/master/win32-darkmode

Only work on Win10. The menu also supports dark mode.

## How To Compile 

copy my files to the orginal 7zip source folder, replace the old files, and compile.

Read this first.
	http://www.ski-epic.com/2012_compiling_7zip_on_windows_with_visual_studio_10/index.html

turns out it uses nmake to compile
	
open "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017"

	cd C:\my7zip\CPP\7zip\
	nmake NEW_COMPILER=1 MY_STATIC_LINK=1


it takes almost 5 minutes to compile

compiled file is in 

	C:\my7zip\CPP\7zip\Bundles\Fm\O\7FM.exe

## Talks

I found a dark theme for 7z before. However, it's based on win7's flatty theme, not going to work on win10's dark theme.

So I decided to do it on my own.

I'll see how to modify tool bars.
