# 7zipDarkmode

![](7zDark.png)

inspired by https://github.com/ysc3839/win32-darkmode/tree/master/win32-darkmode

and https://github.com/Nukem9/SkyrimSETest	(starting from 0.04)


Only work on Win10. The menu also supports dark mode. In version 0.04 there might be some visual issues if you open file properties in the FileManager.

## How To Compile 

use Nukem9's https://github.com/Nukem9/detours Project to compile detours.lib with compiler setting /Gr

and copy detours.lib to CPP\7zip\Bundles\Fm and CPP\7zip\UI\FileManager

copy my files to the 7zip source folder, replace the old files, and compile.

Read this first.

turns out it uses nmake to compile
	
open "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017"

	cd C:\my7zip\CPP\7zip\
	nmake NEW_COMPILER=1 MY_STATIC_LINK=1


it takes almost 5 minutes to compile

compiled file is in 

	C:\my7zip\CPP\7zip\Bundles\Fm\O\7FM.exe

## Talks

I found a dark theme for 7z before. However, it's based on win7's flatty theme, not going to work on win10's dark theme.

So I decided to do it on my own.
